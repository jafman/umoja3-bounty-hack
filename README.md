# Single Deadline Crowdfunding Campaign
## Introduction
Crowdfunding works by having multiple people contribute a small amount to a project, a new business, or a cause. Usually, the pool of people is large, and they may not know each other, which is where the “crowd” in crowdfunding comes from. Instead of having just a few investors fund the venture, crowdfunding allows a lot more people to give a little bit of money.
